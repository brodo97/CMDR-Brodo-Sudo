# Atlas üåå
Atlas is a hobby project that I created to learn the automation of RESTful API using the [SpaceTraders](https://spacetraders.io/) game/codebase which is

> a programmable fleet-management game played through a headless API. Build your own UI, automate your trade routes, or just enjoy the game from the comfort of your terminal.

## Roadmap
- Command Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with the APIs written in Python, later with [curses](https://docs.python.org/3.10/howto/curses.html), [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) or [blessings](https://github.com/erikrose/blessings) üêç
- Implementing the same logic in a web application using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) ‚öóÔ∏è
- Finally, rewriting the Flask code in JavaScript and packaging the application with Electron ‚öõÔ∏è
