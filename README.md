# CMDR-Brodo-Sudo ðŸŒŒ

Two major passions and hobbies guide my everyday life:
- Programming
- Space

Why not combine the two?

Here is CMDR Brodo Sudo's journey inside the JSON galaxy.

## What is that?

This is a script to automate [SpaceTraders](https://spacetraders.io/)' requests. SpaceTraders is:

> a programmable fleet-management game played through a headless API. Build your own UI, automate your trade routes, or just enjoy the game from the comfort of your terminal.
